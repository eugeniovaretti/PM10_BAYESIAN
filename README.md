# Installation

## For end users
The repository contains as module the `bayesmix` library, a C++ library for running MCMC simulations in Bayesian mixture models.

**Prerequisites**: to build `bayesmix` you will need `git`, `pkg-config` and a recent version of `cmake`.

On Linux machines, it is sufficient to run
```shell
 sudo apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y
 sudo apt-get -y install git
 sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip
 sudo python3 -m pip install cmake
 sudo apt-get install -yq pkg-config
```

On macOS, after install HomeBrew, replace `sudo apt-get -y` with `brew`.

To install and use the repository, please 'cd' to the folder you wish to install it, and clone it through the following command-line instructions:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/eugeniovaretti/PM10_BAYESIAN
```
or

```shell
git clone --recursive git@github.com:eugeniovaretti/PM10_BAYESIAN
```
In the latter case you have to register your ssh keys on a github account.


## How to build `bayesmix`
You need to set up bayesmix to run properly the code.  
To build the executable for the main file `run_mcmc.cc`, please use the following list of commands:
```shell
git submodule update
cd bayesmix
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DDISABLE_TESTS=ON
make run_mcmc
cd ..
cd ..
```

# Reproducibility  
This section is intended for any user who wants to run the analysis to reproduce the same results, or for any user who wants to analyze results with different hyperparameter values (in particular, the code is optimized and automated to test grids of totalmass (`totalmass`) and distance (`a`) values), or for those who want to apply the same model to their own data.  
The repository is structured as follow:
- `bayesmix` : contains the submodule that performs the MCMC simulations.  
- `input_data` : contains all the input data (time series and covariates for the model).  
- `output_plot` : empty folder useful to collect results when the `main.Rmd` and the algorithm are runned.  
- `python_implementation` : contains the vanilla python implementation of the model. It is useful to better (and more easily) understand the algorithm and the model implementation. In addition, it is useful for comparing the performance of the same algorithm implemented in C++ (much faster).  
- `utils` : contains the utilities developed for the main script.
- `main.Rmd` : notebook that serves as a comprehensive guide for preparing data and interpreting the output from the MCMC algorithm. The script guides you through the process of data preparation, up to the _MCMC Algorithm_ section, where you are prompted to run the C++ code using the `run.sh` file. The final _Result_ section guides you through the interpretation of the results, ensuring a seamless and effective analysis.
- `run.sh` : bash script to facilitate the execution of the c++ algorithm. It uses the files produced by the first sections of `main.Rmd`. One can specify the two parameters `a` and `M` as arguments. The default values are `a=250` and `M=0.567`.
